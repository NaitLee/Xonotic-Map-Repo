One map may have several "bsps", and entry display is per bsp.
So when it say "showing maps 1 to 60", it isn't always 60 entries on-screen -- maybe more because multiple bsps would be together.

The format converter is in `conv/conv.go`.
"shasum" key is omitted as for now, for it isn't used & taking space.
With it done, the binary files are 1.9MiB in total, or 757KiB after GZip compression.
You can enable it by changing a boolean constant in the file.

The server `serve/serve.go` is just a plain simple server.
Any HTTP server can be used to host the frontend.
I'm thinking about "integration" mode, more in todo.txt, in which a local server would be useful.

The frontend have a config file: `www/config.json`
Inside you can config Upstream, i.e. a backend that gives Mapshots & Downloads etc.
The default choice is http://xonotic.fps.gratis/. But everyone is free to host an instance: https://github.com/z/xonotic-map-repository
The problem is how one can get all of the community maps downloaded.
Besides that, there are entity "blacklists" for omitting "senseless" things.
Some (currently) unavailable gamemodes, and unknown/little entities, are omitted by default.
You can see them by removing from blacklist. See what do the entries mean in translation file `www/lang/en-US.json`

The frontend code isn't well made. At the time of coding I'm trying out the React.js way of doing interface,
thus didn't follow traditional practice (that is actually better).
This isn't a big project, though. Please ignore that :P

Translation files are in `www/lang`.
And edit `www/i18n-ext.js` to fit grammar request.
